Initial thoughts before play:

This game is really underrated
I think there's a lot of nuance and depth to the story that you simply don't expect from a game like this
It felt very magical to play through as a kid

Difficulty? I don't remember this from the original. Neat.

Dreams, forgotten dreams, dreams forgetting us
Uneasy but curious feeling
Mysterious figure crying for help

Leorina and Tammy/cat thing show up? Priestess?

The "fake language" thing is really curious...
Is it like the feeling of a dream? Do other Klonoa games do this?

Dream traveler? They know Klonoa?

How does Lolo know to turn into a magic orb of energy and enter Klonoa's ring?

They're also called "Visions"... interesting

They added coop? Oh shit, this is an actual full remaster huh...

They're called "Dream Stones" (the currency)

First stage

"_Seaway_"
This song is upbeat, but it always made me feel a bit sad, melancholic even.
It has these long drawn violins but this fast beat and backing to it
But hopeful in nature with the violing crescendo and dreamlike instrumentation

The "Save" is an alarm clock, like waking up from a dream...

Also what are these little red creatures we're using to get around lol

_Calm sea_ - Mellow, tranquil, relaxing

Klonoa loves to have these indoor sections with a different version of the
track. Helps with the pace of the game.

_Going to lunatea_ - This one is whimsical and fun, as you start flying on
top of this bird as we near the end of the stage. It almost signals the
adventure ahead of us.

Lolo wants to become a **full** priestess. When we help her ring the bell
at tend of Seaway, she is excited for her accomplishment. So she needed
us, likely why she ran into us. By how did she know we could ring the
bell? Are there other ring users like us in this world?

It's almost like Klonoa recognizes the name Lunatea???

Baguji's Island

Baguji also knows Klonoa as the Dream Traveler. Lolo brought us here and
called Baguji "Master Baguji".

Baguji foretold our arrival at the **Sea of Tears**, and that's why they
were waiting for us. But how did Leorina know?

Points us to the **Bell of Harmony**. There are 4 bells in each of the
kingdoms of Lunatea.

Bells "maintain peace throughout the world" - Lolo

"A bell of darkness that belongs to none of the Kingdoms. A Fifth Bell is
about to be delivered to our world." - Baguji

This bell is "causing the chaos in the Kingdoms"

Monsters running around, priestesses falling ill (Leorina was
a priestess!)

Lolo is going to now become a full priestess, probably due to her ringing
the bell. Her character seems shy and clumsy.

End of session:

Missed songs: Lolo!, Baguji The Wiseman, the main map music

Feb 16th:

_La-Lakoosha_:

_Path of Goddess Claire_ - relaxing and calm. Rushing water and wind,
closeness to nature while traversing this structure. Ties in to what I'd
feel in this game as "religion" and "spirituality"

_Cave of Glimmer Moss_ - same feeling, but the mushrooms allow the use of
that terraria mushroom biome sound, not sure what that instrument is.
Something about it makes me feel like nothing could go wrong in the world.

Also, we see these statues everywhere, but no idea what they do yet. Look
like budhha statues.

Lolo stops to pray by the statuo of goddess Claire?(check name). The
earlier statue at the _Sea of Tears_ was of Claire the ancient, and it was
"all that remained after she was purged of all evil."

We meet the high priestess. It's interesting that there is danger or evil,
and Lolo is the one to solve it? What about all these senior priestesses
and godesses and whatnot?

The bell rang earlier was the _Spirit Bell_.

Lolo becomes a Priestess and is tasked with ringing the four _Harmony
Bells_ to gather their power. Turns out that bell Baguji referenced
earlier must have a more specific name, as they're all Harmony.

She must do this to "contain the evil".

First bell: _Bell of Tranquility_

The high priestess also knows us by name. "You're a kind lad, watch over
our Lolo". How does everyone know who we are? Even Klonoa is confused.

_Claire Moa Temple_:

We're introduced to Leorina as she stops us on the way to the Bell of
Tranquility. "A bandit, wreacking havoc on the world for treasure". Tat is
the name of the Cat. They call themselves Sky Pirates.

_Leorina_'s theme makes a debut. I love this theme, it's super
stereotypical super villain, masking the true nature of Leorina, as we
know her story is deeper than that.

_Folgaran_ track is almost psychedelic, industrial for sure. Feels like
Volkan.

Leorina doesn't know our name. Maybe Baguji told everyone else our name.
But she still knows we're the Dream Traveler and knew how to find us. If
Baguji didn't tell her, who did?

As we capture tranquility, we hold the element in our hands, but hear the
mysterious dream voice call out for help again. The music slows down
slightly.
