# Elysia with Bun runtime

## WIP (as all things are)

Site live @ https://blog-hv43.onrender.com/

UI/UX Inspired by my favorite neovim plugin, [nvim/telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)

Color pallete from my favorite theme, [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) - Frappe flavored

## Todo:

- [x] Implement search by blog
- [x] Parse markdown
- [ ] Parsing images for blog posts
- [ ] Improve blog data structure to contain metadata (move to Turso?)
- [ ] Add date published, edit history, version history
- [ ] Resizing of telescope UI for mobile
- [ ] Figure out mobile solution for commands
- [ ] Add search by content (ripgrep style telescope)

## Development

To start the development server run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.
