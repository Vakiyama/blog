# Distill

### Summary

the following should be escaped \* \* \* \*_not escaped_; \*test\*

Take notes thinking about how they will be read in the future. Notes
should contain the main idea. You're not only the taker, but you are
also the giver of notes.

If you can't understand the notes then they become useless.

### Details

Iterate through notes and _highlight important parts_. Bring down the
amount of highlighting from blocks down to words or phrases. _Narrow the
scope of your notes_ for the busy reader.

_Don't be afraid of taking a large amount_ of notes in the collecting
phase, as you'll be able _to distill them later_.

_If you come back_ to a set of notes _often_, _increase_ its
_discoverability_ whenever you do.

When you come to read a note, you can _tell at a glance how important_ it
might really be.

_Don't highlight when you capture_, as you don't know what future you will
need with your notes. _Assume all your notes will be useless_ until deemed
useful. This will save you time and _make capturing more frictionless_.

_Leave your notes better than you found them._

_Listen for that voice of resonance_ when re-reading notes to tell what
is important to keep.
