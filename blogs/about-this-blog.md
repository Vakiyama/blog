Bun, Elysia, Turso, HTMX

## Bun

Easy and enjoyable developer experience. Running typescript, my default
mode of operation, has been incredible with bun.

I've always used Bun with Node.js compatibility and API's in mind, as I'm
often using it for other courses. I can finally experiment with the Bun
native API's. I'm currently just using the "Bun.file" api to read in
markdown, but it's been great so far.

## Elysia

I heard about elysia in the video that inspired this tech stack,
[beth stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpzowDDJj24).

It seems to be designed to be specifically used with Bun, which is great,
although I'm not 100% sure what we're gaining using Bun versus Node. Maybe
it's using Bun API's under the hood?

We're doing a lot of Express.js work at the course I'm taking at BCIT for
FSWD. It's great, and familiar, but I am curious to see what a more modern
backend framework can offer instead of express.

The API so far feels pretty good, and they have clearly made the
experience familiar for someone coming off of Express. Still, it's early days.

Built in JSX support is awesome. I'm comfortable with JSX with my
background doing mostly React front end stuff, so using it in a project
like this is fantastic.

### A small aside on templating...

I've been using a lot of [EJS](https://ejs.co/) in school projects, and
I will say, I'm not a huge fan. Not having type information in my
templates leads to a bunch of runtime issues, especially during big
refactors. Which is what I'm using typescript for in the first place.
