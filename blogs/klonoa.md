# outline

## Bridge

This is obviously quite disorganized, so you'll have to sequence and
distill this into something more cohesive.

This will serve dual function for you as a blog post to kick off the
project, and also as an outline of what you want to do. Make sure to first
focus on the outline, and then the blog post. Distill, and then Sequence.

You'll have to include links, images and potentially videos in the blog
post, which much of what's below is missing.

Think about communication, audience, 7C's, so on when writing the blog.

Next steps:

- [x] Check page 194 of Second Brain to see if there's anything else you
      potentially missed.
- [x] Distill
- [ ] Sequence into blog post
- [ ] Get some feedback
- [ ] Deliver blog

- Think about potentially adding threads/folders to the blog. The folders
  idea is neat, and it'll help organize everything. Up to you.

## Summary

Overall project outline, goals, motivations and thoughts on the _Klonoa
Project_.

## Goals

The final, largest _goal of this project is the video essay_. I'd like to
look into _Jacob Gellier's work to inspire the video_, as I admire his
style. Also, look into \*videos done on games, especially one to two hour
long ones.

On the way, I'd like to _chunk the project into blog posts_ talking about
different sections of the game. The size of each chunk will be determined
by how much scope I'd like to take on at a time. I'm thinking something
between _major "Chapters" for each of the major areas_ (I believe there
are 5), _or a post for each major stage_.

_Major stages_ have some _longer length of gameplay_, multiple sections,
or _a more complete storyline_ on its own.

Minor stages are things like talking to Baguji in between stages, or small
boss fights and sequences. They can or should be joined with a major
stage.

I'll see how the work gets divided as I start feeling the scope of the
project.

_I'll post each of these blogs
[blog-ideas](projects/htmx-blog/blogs/1707599467-blog-ideas.md) on my htmx
blog_ I've worked on. This will give that project some life.

Then, I'll _use_ all of the _intermediate packets generated_ along the way
(blogs, notes, ideas) as I write these blogs _to structure the final
video_.

I'd like to go through several _divergence/convergence stages_ as
I develop the project.

I'll have to go through _one or more iterations when generating each blog
post_, then a large iteration when I assemble the video structure.

Also, before the video essay, _I might want to refine down the work into
one large blog post_. Should help with the structure? Not sure.

I think I can use the
_[convergence](projects/second-brain/1708214031-convergence.md)
techniques_ to structure the project as a whole.

Each _blog post is an archipelago of ideas_; stepping stones I'll build
the project out of. I'll (hopefully) _get immediate feedback_ on parts as
I write them from peers.

I should _end each blog post with a hemingway bridge to the next_ ideas it
leads to. This does not have to be leading toward the next chronological
blog in the story of the game, as that's a bit arbitrary.

I want to _leave each blog with the questions I'd like to answer_ next
time I visit the project, or when I start building out the video essay.

## Motivations

This _game is just incredible_, and I know it is. I'd like to not only
_learn why I feel so strongly about this_, and why it captivated me as
a child, but why it also _draws me back as an adult_.

Once I _learn why this game means so much to me_, I'll have hopefully
learned something about myself, and other fans of the game can maybe see
themselves in those things I'll learn.

I'll also be able to _show the world how incredible this game is_.
I always hope this game gets more recognition for how well crafted its
story and world are.

I also feel like there's just a _greater message to draw from the game_
other than it's ability to transport me to a fantasy world.

_There are nuanced themes here_, I know it. I just don't know how to
describe them, and I don't think anyone else has. I've seen reviews on the
game, but that's not the focus of this project.

## Method

I'm playing through the remastered version released on Steam for the PC,
the Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series.

I'll be _recording each play session with OBS_ and _taking notes as
I play_. I've played this game many times before, so I'm familiar with
major story beats and characters.

I've already written the notes for and recorded the first 2 stages. _As
I've started taking notes_, I realize _there's so many questions that come
up_ as I play through about characters, motivations and the world. _If
I weren't taking notes_ as those questions come up, theres likely a chance
that _I'd forget them entirely._

This method does quite slow me down, and takes me out of the experience
a little each time I need to document something.

I think that I've still _become far more perceptive, and less anxious,
about the information_ the game lays out if I know I should be writing it
down. It's really unique, I've never played a game in such an analytical
way.

## Music and World

I think that the _music of this game is just fantastic_. Feel free to
listen to it on Spotify, as I have in preparation for this project.

I will likely _focus a lot on the music of this game_ to help _describe_
the _feelings that the world and its locations generate_. I think that
using it as background music to each respective part of the video essay,
or stopping and breaking down a song for a specific part of the story, can
have some powerful effects on a viewer.

There's some _feelings that the game's music can convey_ that are probably
_better than what I can put into words_. I also think that anyone who's
played the game will be able to _recognize the game_ and their _memories_
with it far better _if they're hearing some familiar music_.

The world is also relatively complex, and there's a _lot of detail in each
area._ I plan to try and _connect the world_ in a way such that a viewer
or reader can easily get a cohesive picture of everything without playing
the game.
